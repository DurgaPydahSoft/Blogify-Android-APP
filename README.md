# blog

Project Description:

I want to develop a basic blog application with the following functionalities:

Landing Page/Welcome Screen:

When the user enters the application, they are presented with two options:
Write a Blog
View Blogs
Write a Blog:

Choosing this option opens a form.
The user can enter:
Title of the blog
Description (or content) of the blog
Upon submitting the form, the blog data is stored in a MongoDB database.
I will provide the connection string for the database.
The data should be saved with appropriate schema fields (e.g., title, description, date, etc.).
View Blogs:

This option fetches all blog entries stored in the MongoDB database.
The retrieved blogs are displayed in a list or grid format, showing the title and description (or a summary).
Additional Details:

Please assume that the backend setup (Node.js/Express or similar) is in place to handle database connections and data storage.
Focus on the frontend logic for the options, form handling, and display.
Use the MongoDB connection string as a variable or a placeholder in my code.
Make the user interface simple and intuitive.
Implement appropriate data flow: from user input to database storage, and from database to display.

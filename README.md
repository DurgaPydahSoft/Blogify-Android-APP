I'll analyze the current workspace to understand the app functionality and features, then create an enhancement plan. Let me start by exploring the codebase structure and key files.

Read file: pubspec.yaml
Read file: lib/main.dart
Read file: lib/screens/home_screen.dart
Read file: lib/screens/write_blog_screen.dart
Read file: lib/screens/view_blogs_screen.dart
Read file: lib/services/blog_service.dart
Read file: lib/models/blog_post.dart
Read file: blog-backend/server.js
Read file: blog-backend/routes/blogs.js
Read file: lib/screens/login_screen.dart
Read file: lib/screens/profile_screen.dart
Now let me check the backend models to understand the data structure better:

Read file: blog-backend/models/Blog.js
Read file: blog-backend/models/User.js
Now let me check the README to understand the project better:

Based on my comprehensive analysis of the codebase, I can now provide you with a detailed understanding of the current app functionality and create an enhancement plan.
